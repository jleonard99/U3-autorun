U3-autorun

I was exploring how to best integrate PortableApps, TrueCrypt and a U3-ready USB to create something that performs like an IronKey.  While I didn't get "there", I did make enough progress to post something to GitHub.

The "nice" feature of U3-ready USB sticks is that they present a portion of their memory as a CD-ROM, enabling the use of autorun and autoplay features that were disabled (and rightly so) in Windows 7 and later service packs in other versions of Windows.

At present this project encapsulates a make workflow so that from the command line all the steps necessary to rebuild ISO images for the CD-ROM portion of U3 sticks are automated.  I gathered the necessary tools, some examples in other languages, URL to sites I found interesting, and other examples that might serve useful for someone interested in extending this work.

Its a start.
